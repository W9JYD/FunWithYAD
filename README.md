# FunWithYAD
A few BASH shell scripts (and their support files) to demonstrate how fun YAD can be.

This is the *new* repo for this project because the old GitHub account is no longer accessible (to me). And anyway, if you look at [my QRZ page](https://www.qrz.com/db/W9JYD "QRZ Login Required"), my former call sign used to be KI5JYD now it is **W9JYD**.

Hopefully more FunWithYAD scripts will be made. Just not enough time in the world to do so, so ***please*** be patient.

73,
